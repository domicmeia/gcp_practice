## Objectives

By following the *Shipping Go*, I aim to deepen my skills in building and managing a production-ready software pipeline tailored for Go applications. Hereâ€™s what I hope to achieve:

1. **Mastering the Basics of CI/CD for Go**  
   - My first goal is to establish a foundational CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deploy stages. This will streamline my workflow and improve my ability to deliver quality code faster.

2. **Practicing an Iterative Development Process**  
   - Through this project, I want to apply an iterative approach to development, where I can refine, release, and revise the application. This is an important practice for me to enhance responsiveness to feedback and continually improve code quality.

3. **Learning Advanced Pipeline Features**  
   - I plan to expand the pipeline with more complex features, focusing on:
     - **Containerization**: Gaining hands-on experience with Docker to package applications consistently across environments.
     - **Integration Testing**: Incorporating automated testing for better code reliability.
     - **Semantic Versioning**: Automating version control practices to streamline releases.
     - **Automated Deployment**: Setting up a robust deployment process that reduces manual steps, helping me deliver faster and with fewer errors.
